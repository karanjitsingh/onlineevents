You had some free time and you planned to visit a nearby water park. There you observed a system of pipes of circular cross section:<br/>
A pipe A has a discharge of 50 m3/s. It is divided into two parts B and C, B has a velocity of 10 m/s and diameter of 1 m. C is further divided in to D and E. And finally E and B meets giving a final discharge of 40 m3/s. Find the discharge in D. Neglect friction and other losses and round off the answer to the nearest whole number
