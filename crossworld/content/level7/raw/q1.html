The mesmerizing view from the top floor of the empire state building left you speechless and then you notice an experiment being conducted by two students. A person A throws a ball from the top of Empire State, at a height of 400m from the ground, another person B throws a ball at the same time in the air at a speed of 100 m/sec. Find the distance covered by ball B after it crosses ball A. (assume g=10 m/sec2 and round off to whole number).
