You are relaxing at a park after a long day and notice the following :<br/>
A fountain sprinkles in a park, the base of the fountain from where it starts has an initial pressure of 200 pa and final pressure of 100 pa. The top most point reached by the water sprinkler is 2m from the ground and the initial velocity is 1m/s. what is the time of flight of the droplet. (At the topmost point the vertical velocity is 0 and round off the answer to the nearest whole number).
