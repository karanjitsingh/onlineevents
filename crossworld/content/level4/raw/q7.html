7. Along with red bus ticket, you received a complementary ride on the London eye. The giant wheel having radius 10m is rotating .Mass of one cubicle inclusive of the passengers is 300Kg. assuming that the giant wheel has been given a velocity so that it just completes a circle. Determine the amount of force that that the giant wheel having radius 10m is rotating .Mass of one cubicle inclusive of the passengers is 300Kg. Assuming that the giant wheel has been given a velocity so that it just completes a circle. Determine the amount of force (in Newton) that the cubicle will experience at the bottom of the loop( Assume g=10m/s2 and neglect losses due to friction and other external losses. (Round off your answer to the nearest whole number)
