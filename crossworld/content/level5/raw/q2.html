Being a engineer you were always fascinated by Dams and hydal power stations, So you decide to pay a visit to the Aswan dam.<br/>
The height of the Aswan dam is 364 feet and the length is 3830 feet. Water falls from that height and rotates a turbine of diameter 1m and mass 400 kg. What is the speed of rotation of the turbine? (Give the answer in round per second, write only  assume g=9.81,and round off to whole number) (eg. If ans is 20 rps, write only 20)
