You visited the Plano Inclinado Goncalves and then wished to travel in it. But instead of buying the ticket they gave you an offer for getting a free ride if you solve the problem given in the image.<br /><br />
Given, in figure, Mass of A= 5kg , Force F= 150 N, Mass of B= ,acceleration of A= , the inclined length = 30 coefficient of friction = 0.5. Find the time (in seconds ) taken for B to cover the entire inclined length from 0 to 30m. (Round off the answer to suitable whole number)
