You are travelling on a train to Iguazu falls and notice, a man at rest throwing a ball in such a way that it returns to him and the train travels at 58.8m. If the train was travelling  with a constant velocity of 14.7m/s on a straight horizontal track .Find the initial speed( in m/s) of the ball as seen from the train. (Take g=9.8 and round off to nearest whole number)
